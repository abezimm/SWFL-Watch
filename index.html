			  <h2>FAQ</h2>
			  <h3>What is a “home watch company”?</h3>
			  <p>A home watch company is a company that provides the service of looking after your home while you’re out of town in order to prevent, report, or even fix issues that might arise while you’re gone (and would otherwise go unnoticed for a long period of time).</p>
			  <h3>Why do I need a home watch company to look after my home?</h3>
			  <p>There are a number of issues that can come up at your home while you’re out of town, some of which could even be prevented with a watchful eye, but it’s not always convenient (or even possible) for a homeowner to be here as frequently as they’d like. That’s where we come in.</p>
			  <p>We can check the mail and pick up flyers/papers to make sure your home doesn’t look vacant, we can check for leaks, make sure your lawn service is mowing the lawn, meet the cable guy, and so much more that would oftentimes warrant an otherwise unnecessary trip. This also makes sure that if there is a serious issue, damage is mitigated as much as possible and timely repairs and/or insurance claims can be made.</p>
			  <h3>How much does the service cost?</h3>
			  <p>We have a number of different plans and additional concierge services that vary depending on frequency. Please see our Service Plans and Concierge Services pages for more details.</p>
			  </h3>How frequently should I have my home checked?</h3>
			<p>This is completely up to you, but we can help you determine what might work best for your situation depending on how long you’ll be away, how frequently your house typically needs maintenance, time of year (i.e. hurricane season), etc. We offer weekly, bi-weekly, and monthly check-ins.</p>
			<h3>Are you a licensed home watch company?</h3>
			<p>There is no specific license for home watch companies in the state of Florida, but we are licensed to do business in the state.</p>
			<h3>Are you bonded?</h3>
			<p>Yes. We are bonded and insured.</p>
